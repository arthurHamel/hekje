# Android App for data entry and visualization in the field of georesistivity survey.

This project was initiated as a workaround for deficient logger memory. Data had to be entered manually by the surveyors.

The App allows the users to enter values manually and visualize directly the results as the survey is conducted.

Possible developpment:</br>
Beyond its initial workaround function, the App can be reused for data visualization from logger using a Bluetooth connection for instance.
Having an overview of the results in field is a clear advantage for deciding of survey strategies.
